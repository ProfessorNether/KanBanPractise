Expense calculator TDD
we are using html, css and JavaScript.
we are programming it using WebStorm.
When you press add income/expense it automatically calculates balance
 you need to add an amount of income/expense and the category for it to calculate but a description is optional
You can see the total of a category under total expense/income.
You can see the total amount of money you have in the middle of the screen
Next to every income/expense there is a delete button.
The site needs to be resizable so you can use it on different devices
It should store the data you entered.
